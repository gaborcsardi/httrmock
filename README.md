Mock HTTP Requests for API Testing

## Installation


```r
devtools::install_github("r-lib/httrmock")
```

## Introduction

TODO

`httrmock` was inspired by https://github.com/assaf/node-replay

## Usage in packages:

TODO

## The database:

`httrmock` uses the `storr` package to store the requests and responses
in RDS files, see `storr::storr()`. By default the database is in the
`tests/testthat` directory, which is appropriate for `testthat` tests.
For an alternative directory, set the `HTTRMOCK_STORE` environment
variable and point it to the directory you wish to use. The directory
will be created if it does not exist.

## Debugging:

`httrmock` uses `debugme` for easy debugging of what is recorded and
replayed, see `debugme::debugme()` for details.
